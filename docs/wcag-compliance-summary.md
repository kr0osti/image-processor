This document summarizes the changes made to ensure UI components meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Viewport Settings
- Updated viewport meta tag to allow user scaling (WCAG 1.4.4 - Resize Text)
- Changed `maximumScale` from 1 to 5
- Changed `userScalable` from false to true

### 2. Form Components
- Enhanced Input component with proper ARIA attributes:
  - Added `aria-describedby` support
  - Added `aria-invalid` support for error states
- Enhanced Textarea component with proper ARIA attributes:
  - Added `aria-describedby` support
  - Added `aria-invalid` support for error states
- Updated Button component:
  - Added default `type="button"` to prevent accidental form submissions

### 3. Image Accessibility
- Enhanced ImageCard component:
  - Added proper TypeScript typing
  - Added `role="figure"` and `aria-labelledby` for better semantics
  - Added screen reader text for image descriptions
  - Improved focus states for interactive elements
  - Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons

### 4. Keyboard Navigation
- Added SkipLink component to allow keyboard users to bypass navigation
- Updated layout to include main content landmark
- Improved focus visibility on interactive elements

### 5. Accessibility Utilities
- Created accessibility utility functions:
  - Color contrast calculation
  - WCAG compliance checking
  - CSS variable parsing
  - Keyboard focusability detection
- Created AccessibilityChecker component for development testing

### 6. Documentation
- Created comprehensive accessibility guide
- Documented WCAG requirements for different component types
- Added testing recommendations

## WCAG Success Criteria Addressed

| Success Criterion | Description | Implementation |

| 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | Provide a way to bypass blocks of content | Added skip link |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Focus order preserves meaning and operability | Improved focus management |
| 2.4.6 Headings and Labels | Headings and labels are descriptive | Enhanced form labels and descriptions |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | Keyboard focus is visible | Enhanced focus states |

## Next Steps

1. **Color Contrast Testing**: Use the AccessibilityChecker component to identify and fix any contrast issues.
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test the application with screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver.
3. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
4. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **User Testing**: Conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technologies.
