# Accessibility Guide for UI Components

This guide outlines the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards that our UI components should meet. Following these guidelines ensures our application is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

## General WCAG Compliance Requirements

### 1. Perceivable
- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content (images, icons)
- **Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media
- **Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- **Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### 2. Operable
- **Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content
- **Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
- **Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

### 3. Understandable
- **Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable
- **Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
- **Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Images
- All images must have appropriate `alt` text
- Decorative images should have empty `alt` attributes (`alt=""`)
- Complex images should have detailed descriptions

### Buttons and Interactive Elements
- All buttons must have accessible names (text content or `aria-label`)
- Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Focus states must be visible
- Touch targets should be at least 44x44 pixels

### Forms
- All form inputs must have associated labels
- Form validation errors must be clearly indicated
- Required fields must be programmatically indicated
- Error messages should be linked to their respective inputs

### Color and Contrast
- Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background (3:1 for large text)
- Color should not be the only means of conveying information
- UI components must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements must be focusable
- Focus order must be logical and intuitive
- Focus must be visible at all times
- No keyboard traps

### ARIA Attributes
- Use ARIA attributes appropriately to enhance accessibility
- Do not change native semantics unless absolutely necessary
- All ARIA controls must be keyboard accessible
- ARIA attributes must be kept up-to-date with component state

## Implementation in Our Components

### Button Component
- Has proper focus states
- Includes type attribute
- Maintains proper contrast ratios

### Input and Textarea Components
- Support for `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid`
- Clear focus states
- Associated labels

### Checkbox Component
- Uses proper ARIA attributes
- Visual indicator has `aria-hidden="true"`
- Keyboard accessible

### Image Components
- Require alt text
- Support for screen reader announcements

### Alert Component
- Uses `role="alert"` for important messages
- Clear visual distinction

## Testing Accessibility

To ensure our components meet WCAG standards:

1. Use automated testing tools like Axe, Wave, or Lighthouse
2. Perform keyboard navigation testing
3. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
4. Check color contrast with tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker
5. Conduct user testing with people who use assistive technologies
