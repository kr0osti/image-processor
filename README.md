# NextJS Image Processor

A powerful web application that allows you to download, process, and standardize images from various sources.

![NextJS Image Processor](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x630/0a0a0a/FFFFFF?text=NextJS+Image+Processor)

## üåü Features

- **Multiple Image Sources**: Upload local files, process direct image URLs, or scrape images from webpages
- **Standardized Processing**: Automatically resize and position images to 1500x1500px
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images at once
- **Download Options**: Download individual images or as a ZIP archive
- **CORS Handling**: Creates placeholders for images that can't be loaded due to CORS restrictions
- **Detailed Logging**: Real-time logs of all processing steps
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Uploaded files are automatically deleted after 1 hour
- **Rate Limiting**: All API endpoints are protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse

## üîç How It Works

The application uses a combination of client-side and server-side technologies:

1. **Image Acquisition**:
   - Direct uploads using the browser's File API
   - URL fetching with server-side actions
   - Web scraping using Cheerio for HTML parsing

2. **Image Processing**:
   - Canvas API for image manipulation
   - Automatic positioning based on image dimensions
   - Placeholder generation for failed images

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Direct downloads as PNG files
   - ZIP archive creation using JSZip

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Running with Docker

The application can be run in two modes: production (default) or development.

#### Production Mode

Use this mode for regular usage with pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-image-processor.git
cd nextjs-image-processor

# Create a .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Set up proper permissions for the uploads directory
chmod +x setup-permissions.sh
./setup-permissions.sh

# Start the application with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

#### Development Mode

Use this mode during development when you want to build the Docker images locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-image-processor.git
cd nextjs-image-processor

# Create a .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Set up proper permissions for the uploads directory
chmod +x setup-permissions.sh
./setup-permissions.sh

# Start the application with Docker Compose using the development configuration
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:6060

> **Important**: If you encounter permission errors when uploading images, make sure the `public/uploads` directory has write permissions for the Docker container. You can fix this by running the `setup-permissions.sh` script.

### üé® Customizing Your Installation

#### Environment Variables

You can customize the application by setting these environment variables in your `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VERSION` | Docker image version to use | latest |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` | The name of your site | NextJS Image Processor |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION` | Site description | A powerful web application... |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Your site's URL | https://yourdomain.com |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_THEME_COLOR` | Theme color (hex) | #000000 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_BACKGROUND_COLOR` | Background color (hex) | #ffffff |
| `CLEANUP_API_KEY` | API key for the cleanup endpoint | change-this-to-a-secure-key |

#### Custom Icons and Branding

You can customize the application's icons and branding by:

1. Creating a `custom-icons` directory on your host machine
2. Adding the following files to that directory:
   - `favicon.ico` - The website favicon
   - `icon-16x16.png` - Small icon (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon-32x32.png` - Medium icon (32x32 pixels)
   - `icon-192x192.png` - Large icon for PWA (192x192 pixels)
   - `icon-512x512.png` - Extra large icon for PWA (512x512 pixels)
   - `icon-maskable-192x192.png` - Maskable icon for Android (192x192 pixels)
   - `icon-maskable-512x512.png` - Maskable icon for Android (512x512 pixels)
   - `apple-icon.png` - Icon for Apple devices (180x180 pixels)
   - `safari-pinned-tab.svg` - SVG icon for Safari pinned tabs

3. The Docker Compose configuration automatically mounts this directory to make your custom icons available to the application.

### üîß System Architecture

The application consists of two Docker containers:

1. **Main Application (app)**: The NextJS application that handles image processing
2. **Cleanup Service (cleanup-cron)**: A dedicated service that runs every minute to delete uploaded files older than 1 hour

#### Docker Compose Configurations

The project includes two Docker Compose configurations:

1. **docker-compose.yaml**: The default configuration that uses pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry
2. **docker-compose.dev.yaml**: Development configuration that builds images locally

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

#### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors when uploading images:

```bash
# Run the setup-permissions script
./setup-permissions.sh
```

#### Docker Issues

If you encounter issues with Docker:

1. Ensure your Docker and Docker Compose are up to date
2. Check that port 6060 is available on your system
3. Verify that the environment variables in your `.env` file are correctly formatted
4. Make sure you have internet access to pull the Docker images from GitHub Container Registry


#### Healthcheck Failures

The application includes a healthcheck that runs every 30 seconds. If the healthcheck fails:

1. Check the container logs: `docker logs nextjs-image-processor`
2. Verify that the application is running: `curl http://localhost:6060/api/healthcheck`
3. Restart the container: `docker compose restart app`

#### Rate Limiting

All API endpoints are protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse. The default limits are:

- Global API limit: 1000 requests per minute across all API endpoints
- Proxy endpoint: 500 requests per minute
- Serve-image endpoint: 120 requests per minute
- Images endpoint: 300 requests per minute
- Cleanup endpoint: 5 requests per minute
- Healthcheck endpoint: 30 requests per minute

If you encounter rate limit errors (HTTP 429), wait a minute before trying again.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Versioning

This project uses semantic versioning. Docker images are tagged with version numbers (e.g., `0.1.0`) as well as `latest`.

You can specify which version to use by setting the `VERSION` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```
# Use a specific version
VERSION=0.1.0

# Or leave it empty to use the latest version
VERSION=
```

If `VERSION` is not set, the `latest` tag will be used by default.

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### CI Workflows

- **CI**: Builds and tests the application on every push and pull request
- **Test**: Runs linting and tests on every push and pull request
- **Security Scan**: Performs security scanning using Snyk and CodeQL
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensures the application meets WCAG accessibility standards
- **Docker Build**: Builds and pushes Docker images for both the main app and cleanup service to GitHub Container Registry

### CD Workflows

- **CD**: Pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry on main branch pushes and tags
  - Images are tagged with branch name, commit SHA, and semantic version (for tags)
  - These images are used by the default `docker-compose.yaml` configuration
- **Deploy to Staging**: Automatically deploys to the staging environment on pushes to the develop branch
- **Deploy to Production**: Deploys to production when a new release is published

### Automated Maintenance

- **Dependabot**: Automatically creates PRs for dependency updates (npm, GitHub Actions, Docker)
