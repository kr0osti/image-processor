A powerful web application that allows you to download, process, and standardize images from various sources.

![NextJS Image Processor](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x630/0a0a0a/FFFFFF?text=NextJS+Image+Processor)

## üåü Features

- **Multiple Image Sources**: Upload local files, process direct image URLs, or scrape images from webpages
- **Standardized Processing**: Automatically resize and position images to 1500x1500px
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images at once
- **Download Options**: Download individual images or as a ZIP archive
- **CORS Handling**: Creates placeholders for images that can't be loaded due to CORS restrictions
- **Detailed Logging**: Real-time logs of all processing steps

## üîç How It Works

The application uses a combination of client-side and server-side technologies:

1. **Image Acquisition**:
   - Direct uploads using the browser's File API
   - URL fetching with server-side actions
   - Web scraping using Cheerio for HTML parsing

2. **Image Processing**:
   - Canvas API for image manipulation
   - Automatic positioning based on image dimensions
   - Placeholder generation for failed images

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Direct downloads as PNG files
   - ZIP archive creation using JSZip
